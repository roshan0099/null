# null

Trying to create a  basic interpreted programming language  to learn more about lexers, tokens, parsing techniques etc.


## Update 

So far null is in its bare bones, it only has var declaration (which is just integer and string) and if statement and a simple while loop done right which again have lots of bugs. As of now working on function declaration and calling.


## Features

- [x] integer type
- [x] string type
- [ ] array
- [x] loop
- [x] if - else condition
- [ ] if - else if
- [ ] simple file handling
- [ ] Ascii support
- [ ] Function

# null

Trying to create a  basic interpreted programming language  to learn more about lexers, tokens, parsing techniques etc.


## Update 

So far null is in its bare bones, it only has var declaration (which is just integer as of now) and if statement done right which again has lots of bugs. As of now working on loops.


## Features

[X] integer type
[ ] string type
[ ] loop
[x] if - else condition
[ ] if - else if
[ ] Function
